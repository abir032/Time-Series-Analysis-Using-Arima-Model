# Time-Series-Analysis-Using-Arima-Model on Covid-19 Dataset
# Authentic data collected from our instructur 
In December 2019 covid-19 was discovered and the overall scenario was very devastated still, we
are struggling and dealing with the covid-19. So, from the dataset, we are trying to predict the
future death case with time-series analysis. We used the ARIMA model of time-series analysis.
We processed our data using different hypotheses to make it acceptable to the ARIMA model as
time series required stationary data. We predicted the future range and we checked the accuracy
of our model using RSS (Residual Sum Square) and it turned out very well.
